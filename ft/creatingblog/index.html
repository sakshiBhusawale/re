            <h1>The world of anime</h1>
            <p>
                Anime is a term for Japanese animation, but in the US, it's often used to refer to a specific style of
                Japanese animation. While anime is not a genre itself, it encompasses a wide range of genres like
                shonen, shojo, seinen, josei, and more, each with its own target audience and themes.
